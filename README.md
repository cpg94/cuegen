# cuegen
## Simple Node Script to create cue-sheet files for PSX binaries. 

Clone the repo and put the binary file that you want to create a cuesheet for in the same folder. Then run, for example:

`yarn start ResidentEvil.bin`

This will create  a `ResidentEvil.cue` file in the same directory with the relevant information inside.
